**Labs for Day 3 involving:**
* Constructing a PCA with transcriptomic data
* Understanding how Fst relates to migration
* Performing a parentage analysis
* Testing for isolation-by-distance

**Links to the google forms to complete for each lab:**
1. [Lab 1: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://forms.gle/SimGRuUuYjTWH5fv6)
2. [Lab 2: Fst From Transcriptomic Data](https://forms.gle/jk3boLgUJoYpj1a46)
3. [Lab 3: Relatedness and Isolation-by-Distance](https://forms.gle/yGc985tCzYNJYikn6)

*Note: The .Rmd & .md files in this directory that correspond to each lab have the same information as the google forms, just in a format that is easier to interpret. Feel free to look at these files as you work through the google forms. Files with the .md extension appear best on GitHub.*

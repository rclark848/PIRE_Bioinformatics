Repository with labs, scripts, data, and links to google forms for part of 2019 Bioinformatics workshop

There are three directories that correspond with a day of the workshop:
* Day 1: Tuesday - June 4, 2019 - Heterozygosity, Ne, HWP, & LD
* Day 2: Wednesday - June 5, 2019 - Selection
* Day 3: Thursday - June 6, 2019 - PCA, Migration & Relatedness

The README of each directory has links to the google forms you will need to fill out as you work through each lab.

The fourth directory contains answer keys for all of the labs.

Today we will explore how to calculate heterozygosity and other measures of genetic diversity. We will start by doing some calculations by hand to get everyone familiar with the theory behind most of the analyses we will run in the future. If this material is review for you, please bear with us. We're starting simple so that everyone is on the same page.
\
\
Remember there are two kinds of heterozygosity:

* __Observed heterozygosity ($H_{o}$)__ is the proportion of individuals that are heterozygous (have two different alleles) at a given locus
* __Expected heterozygosity ($H_{e}$)__ is the probability of picking two different alleles from a population if you sampled randomly

$H_{e}$ = $H_{o}$ if a population meets Hardy-Weinberg Proportions (HWP).
\
\
In this lab, we are going to calculate the allele frequencies, $H_{o}$ and $H_{e}$ at a particular locus in a sample population. As a quick reminder, the equation for these terms are as follows:
\
\
___Allele frequencies___ can be calculated as: $\frac{copies\,of\,given\,allele}{total\,number\,alleles\,in\,population}$
\
\
___Observed heterozygosity ($H_{o}$)___ can be calculated as: $\frac{N(Het)}{N}$ where $N(Het)$ is the number of individuals that are heterozygous at a given locus and $N$ is the total number of individuals in the population.
\
\
___Expected heterozygosity ($H_{e}$)___ can be calculated as: $2pq$ where $p$ is the allele frequency of allele 1 and $q$ is the allele frequency of allele 2 (at a biallelic locus).

## *__Heterozygosity by hand__*
\
Navigate to <https://github.com/rclark848/PIRE_Bioinformatics>. This is a repository that contains .md (markdown) and .Rmd (R markdown) copies of all the labs we will be doing over the next three days. It is also home to any data, scripts, or input files you will need for the upcoming analyses. Open up the directory titled `Day_1_Labs` and then download the Excel file titled `Genotypes.xlsx`. (Click on `Genotypes.xlsx` and then click `Download`.)
\
The first line of the data file shows you four things, each in a cell: 1) the number of loci, 2) the number of individuals, 3) the number of populations, and 4) the number of individuals in the first population. Enter this below:
\
\
*Number of loci:* **10**
\
\
*Number of individuals:* **25**
\
\
*Number of populations:* **3**
\
\
*Number of individuals in population #1:* **8**
\
The third line of the file begins the genotype data. Column 1 has the individual ID, column 2 has the population name, and columns 3 and 4 have the two alleles for each individual (these individuals are diploid) at a particular locus. The alleles are coded as 1 or 2 (e.g., these might represent A and T at a single nucleotide polymorphism).
\
\
*What is the genotype of individual J19?*
\
**2,2**
\
*What is the allele frequency of allele #1?*
\
(Hint: Refer to the first page of the lab if you forget how to calculate allele frequencies. In Excel, simply click on a blank cell and type `=`. Then count the number of times allele 1 appears and type that after the `=`. Divide that by the total number of alleles in the population. Hit `enter`.)
\
**Allele frequency of allele 1 = 3/16 = 0.1875** 
\
\
*What is the allele frequency of allele #2?*
\
**Allele frequency of allele 2 = 13/16 = 0.8125**
\
\
*What is your expected heterozygosity ($H_{e}$)?*
\
(Hint: Refer to the first section of the lab if you forget how to calculate $H_{e}$. In Excel, simply click on a blank cell and type `=2`. Then multiply that two by the two allele frequencies you just calculated. Hit `enter`.)
\
**$H_{e}$ = 2pq = 2 x 0.1875 x 0.1825 = 0.304688**
\
\
*What is your observed heterozygosity ($H_{o}$)?*
\
(Hint: Refer to the first section of the lab if you forget how to calculate $H_{o}$. In Excel, simply click on a blank cell and type `=`. Then count the number of heterozygotes in the population and type that after the `=`. Divide that by the total number of individuals in the population. Hit `enter`.)
\
**$H_{o}$ = 3/8 = 0.375**
\
\
*How does the expected heterozygosity compare to the maximum possible heterozygosity for a biallelic locus?*
\
**The maximum possible heterozygosity is 0.5 (2 x 0.5 x 0.5). Here, our $H_{e}$ is less than the maximum possible heterozygosity.**
\
\
*What are the implications of a very low heterozygosity for an individual locus? Why?*
\
**Very low heterozygosity can lead to reduced fitness. Lower heterozygosity also indicates higher homozygosity, which means deleterious recessive alleles are more likely to come together in homozygotes and be exposed to selective pressure.**
\
\
\
\
*Do the observed and expected heterozygosities match? Using your judgment, does the population seem to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at this locus?*
\
*(Hint: $H_{e}$ is expected heterozygosity assuming population is at HWE.)*
\
**$H_{o}$ and $H_{e}$ are close, but don't match exactly. Our results suggest a slight heterozygosity excess but this is likely due to sampling error and small sampling sizes, and probably not a statistically significant difference.**

Exit out of Excel when you are done.

## *__Understanding the inbreeding coefficient__*
\
We can also calculate a metric denoted as $F_{IS}$, otherwise known as the inbreeding coefficient. This can be thought of as the probability that two alleles at a given locus are identical by descent (inherited from same ancestor). It also represents the mean *reduction* in the *heterozygosity* of an individual due to inbreeding, or non-random mating within a subpopulation. Its value can range from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating a complete reduction in heterozygosity (all individuals are homozygous at a given locus).
\
\
We can estimate the inbreeding coefficient ($F_{IS}$) for an individual by hand using the following formula:
\
$F = 1 - [H_{o}/H_{e}]$
\
\
*What do you think an $F_{IS}$ of 0 indicates?*
\
**An $F_{IS}$ of 0 indicates that $H_{o}$ = $H_{e}$ and there is no heterozygosity deficit or excess. The population is at HWP, and is randomly mating (no inbreeding).**
\
\
*Using your previously calculated values of $H_{e}$ and $H_{o}$, what is the inbreeding coefficient for individual J19? (Show your work.)*
\
**F = 1 - ($H_{o}$/$H_{e}$) = 1 - (0.375/0.304688) = 1 - 1.23 = -0.23**
\
\
*How does inbreeding affect long-term population fitness? Why?*
\
**Inbreeding reduces long-term population fitness because it results in an increase in homozygosity and the expression of deleterious recessive alleles. (One generation of random mating will correct this, however.)**
